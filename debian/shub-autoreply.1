.SH SYNOPSIS

.RI [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B shub-autoreply
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBshub-autoreply\fP is a program that is used from a MTA, or a MDA, to enable
per-recipient autoreplies.  If it is designed at all, it is designed for
simplicity. It looks in the template directory for a single file with the same
name as the recipient address, and returns the content of this file as a
message body via SMTP to the sender address.
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.
For a complete description, see the Info files.
